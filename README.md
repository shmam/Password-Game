P@$$W0RD is a simple yet challenging password cracking game. Take your shot at cracking your way into the accounts, with only minimal information provided. Prompted with only a picture, bio, and age, see if you can guess the right password.

### Status: Development :closed_lock_with_key:
While the game is still currently in development, a beta will be released soon for testing and trial purposes
